Hello, 
I am Sukhbir Singh, an undergraduate from National Institute of Technology Hamirpur. I worked with "Amahi" Organization as Google Summer of Code Student over last summer. It was the most exciting summer I ever had. Weekly meetings, Daily challenges, Discussion about Silicon Valley culture, Learning more about Ruby on Rails framework, Making good connections and what else could we imagine.

During this period, I have worked with core team of Amahi to develop features and functionalities for the latest release of Amahi known as "Amahi 11", which is the newer version of linux powered home server. 

## Project Details
- Student: Sukhbir Singh
- Github: [https://github.com/sukhbir-singh](https://github.com/sukhbir-singh)
- GSoC Project Link: [Amahi 11 Improvements](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6139448354406400)
- Organization: [Amahi](https://github.com/amahi/)

This project requires working knowledge of Ruby on Rails, Javascript and Web development. Along with other CS fundamentals like caching, ssh, operating system etc. 

The aim of my project is to:-
- Improve entire front-end of platform using bootstrap-4.
- Fix existing bugs and upgrading the project to Rails 5.2 version.
- Provide support to dynamic theme installation.
- Make apps installation on platform more reliable and user-friendly and also providing caching support to it. 
- Implement new plugins from scratch and providing support to existing plugins.
- Implement sharing of folders among the friend servers, also called friending feature.

Each plugin adds a new feature to the system. As part of this project, I have developed plugins for detecting hard drive failures using S.M.A.R.T status, and a plugin for creating incremental backups periodically which is based on Rsnapshot tool. 

Lastly, I have collaborated with another GSoC student Chirag, to implement friending feature for Amahi. This feature aims to provide sharing functionality of folders among friends. This feature consists of two parts - implementing REST APIs and developing friending plugin and providing this plugin support in platform. I did the Implementation of friending plugin and platform support part. By using the friending plugin an Amahi user can add friends and can give them access to their folders and can manage friend requests sent.
